description: "Or is it a Programming blog, I can't tell..."
---

This is a blog about the intersection of parenting and engineering. As I have
become a parent, I have noticed that many of the strategies that work in
parenting are similar to those used in my job as a software engineer. And also,
I thought of this domain name and felt it only appropriate to make my first
committed attempt to blog a drawn-out, terrible pun.

The format of this blog will be as follows:

## A Parenting Experience
Something that happens to me as a Parent that triggers some sort of ah-ha moment
or similarity to programming.

## A Learning
How this relates experience relates to programming or being an engineer.

That's it!

I hope someone finds this useful, if not I can at least show my children some
thoughts they inspired, intentional or otherwise.
