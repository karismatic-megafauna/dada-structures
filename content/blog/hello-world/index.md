## What is this?

On January 12th, 2020 I became a father. In anticipation of this event my
excitement grew at the opportunity to really embrace fatherhood. There was so
much to do! Where to start! What books do I read? What should his / her name be?
What programming language should he / she learn first?

So many questions. So little time.

So I did the first logical thing I could think of.

Buy a domain name, containing a pun (very important!), that I would never use as
an elaborate form of procrastination but gave the _illusion_ of productivity.

And that is how I thought of "dadastructures" the place where I talked about:

Being a dad and programming?

Or was it giving programming advice to dads?

Or dad advice to programmers?

..._sigh_...

## So this is just some elaborate joke?

No! I am actually going to blog here because there are some good learnings from
being a father that have helped me become a better programmer and I would like
to share those. Also I have always wanted to blog and I love being a father and
programming so this works nicely :)

Here is the tentative format I will be proceeding with.

A post will contain the two following things:

1. An experience from parenting
2. A learning from that experience which gives programming / tech advice

So, if you want to read some funny stories about being a parent and watch as I
find a way to relate them to tech, then you are definitely in the right place.

See ya next sprint!
